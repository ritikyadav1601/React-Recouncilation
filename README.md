# React Reconciliation Demo

This project is a simplified JavaScript implementation that demonstrates how **React's Reconciliation algorithm** works under the hood.

The goal is to help beginners understand how React:
- Tracks UI changes using a virtual DOM
- Compares old and new states (diffing)
- Efficiently updates only what's changed in the DOM (reconciliation)

## ðŸš€ Features

- Custom implementation of virtual DOM diffing
- Add, update, and remove "todos"
- DOM manipulation based on state differences
- No external libraries â€” just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

This project mimics how React performs:

- **State management**
- **Virtual DOM tracking**
- **Efficient DOM updates**
- **Reconciliation**
